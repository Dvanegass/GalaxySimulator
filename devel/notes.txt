Checklist for making a new release:

- Run test suite on as many machines as possible.
- On each machine, run:
  - python setup.py tests
  - run_all_tests (in tests directory. go get some coffee...)
  - check_yaml (in examples directory)
  - check_json (in examples directory)
  - check_des (in examples directory)
- Make the release branch for the new minor version. (or switch to it if doing a bugfix release)
    git checkout -b releases/M.m
    git push -u origin releases/M.m
- Update the version number to the new M.m.r value in galsim/_version.py
- Read over the CHANGELOG.rst file and edit as needed.
- Update any docs that might need updating.
- Make sure the current code is installed:
    python setup.py install
- Generate current docs
    update_docs
- Commit and push new docs.  (Assuming there were any changes from the last time this was done.)
    git add docs/_build
    git commit -m "update docs"
- Cherry pick this commit back on master.
- Tag the current version
    git tag -a vM.m.r -m "vM.m.r"
    git push --tags
- Get the current version onto pip.  (Maybe check again that the current version is installed!)
    rm -r GalSim.egg-info
    python setup.py sdist
    tar tvfz dist/GalSim-M.m.r.tar.gz
    twine upload dist/GalSim-M.m.r.tar.gz
    pip install -UI galsim  (To test that it worked)
- Back in master, update version number to M.(m+1) (i.e. no .r)
- Move the CHANGELOG information into docs/history.rst and clear out the current CHANGELOG.rst
  file for the next version.
- Email galsim-announce list about the new version.
